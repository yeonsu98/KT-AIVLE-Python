Normally, I've found these creams - even with positive reviews - aren't all they claim to be. This is the exception. I use this in the evening, after I've washed my face. I always sleep with a fan on and normally wake up with very dry skin. Not with this cream, my skin still feels hydrated, even with the fan blowing on me. I was really impressed. My daughter also tried it and, without my even asking her if she liked it, she said the same thing as I did. It really keeps your skin soft, but the cream is NOT heavy feeling or greasy. I am trying their under eye cream at present -- fingers crossed! I've found Korean products to be very effective and much less expensive than the US brands. While I would prefer to buy US products, the quality isn't there and the price is too high. This cream is well worth the price because it really does what it says it will. 1 1\n","I'm a long standing user of Amazon Prime and am guilty of too many one-click purchases; however, this is the first review I'm leaving, it that says anything. I LOVE this product. I was looking for a very moisturizing (non-greasy) lotion for the winter that would also help the eczema around my eyes, chin and mouth area. I've suffered from dry skin, roughness and itchiness from eczema for about a year now and this has been a true lifesaver in the 2 weeks I've had it. I apply it morning and night underneath my makeup and immediately, the dryness goes away and my skin is left feeling supple and smooth. I'll occasionally reapply the moisturizer around my eyes if it feels a little tight during the day (office heat is terrible for winter skin), however, the moisture level of this creme truly lasts ALL DAY. My skin has never felt more soft and I also have noticed a better glow to my skin.I've been taking Vital Proteins Collagen for about 2 weeks now also, and that may contribute a little. But I completely think 95% of the benefits I've seen is from this creme alone. I let my mother try it too and now she's wanting 2 tubs of it for Christmas. I might look into the Aqua version for the summer. I think it's light enough for both summer/winter wear though. 1 1\n","I love this product! I am so surprised by the negative reviews here. I believe that many consumers are confused by the two formulas from belif.The Moisturizing Bomb is my holy grail product for dry and sensitive skin. It has given my skin some relief in the desert climate of Arizona.The Aqua Bomb should be used by those with oily skin or those who prefer a lightweight moisturizer that will disappear quickly.I have purchased the moisturizing bomb from Sephora before and will be saving a few dollar by purchasing through Amazon. I personally do not see a difference in the formula. 1 0\n","I've been using this for about a month now in addition to my other skincare regimen and my dry skin has made significant improvements. I use this product as a base underneath my sunscreen and primer and my foundation goes on flawlessly. I usually prefer that my facial moisturizers have a thicker consistency so I don't feel the dry, cracking discomfort of my naked skin, but the Moisturizing Bomb gets absorbed so quickly that makes my skin feel naturally smooth. I like that the scent is quite mild and fresh as well. 5/5 would order again. 1 1\n","I get very dry skin that make my frown lines look twice as bad as normal. I’ve tried lots of creams, including some from expensive stores. I got a sample of this brand (aqua bomb) and liked how it helped. I chose this kind instead because I read it was for dry skin. I’ve been very happy with how much it helps soften those frown lines. I use it at night, sometimes in the morning too, and it is never too heavy, just moisturizing. 1 1\n","I LOVE my belif moisturizer. I received it as a sample in one of my subscription boxes. I don't remember which one because I have so many. I liked it so much I bought the normal size which was HUGE to my surprise. I use it everyday and my aging skin looks fabulous! 1 1\n","Perfect for winter, wears wonderfully under makeup. Not heavy or greasy, absorbs fully so at first I was concerned it wouldn’t be hydrating enough but my skin isn’t at all dry which is not easily achieved. The little dry fine lines on my cheeks are gone. Will definitely stick with this one. 1 1\n","GREAT FOR SENSETIVE SKIN! Only use a little because it will only take a little to do your whole face. Use a lot and it will be grease city! 1 1\n","The best skincare product possibly ever. It's simple, you can use it night or day. It works well under makeup and is very light while providing fantastic hydration. Just a small amount will do. I wish the company would formulate a version with spf 30, but that being said, great skin cream. 1 1\n","Finally found the perfect moisturizer!!! I love the smell and it does its job wonderfully. I have Paula's Choice moisturizer, but this product is way more moisturizing. Perfect for dry LA winter weather. 1 1\n","This is hands down the best moisturizer I've ever used, especially in winter when it's extra dry outside. No oily residue, no shiny skin, works great! 1 1\n","I got this in a Sephora sample and loved it! Really moisturizes and hydrates my dry skin! 1 1\n","Best face cream in the world! So hydrating, keeps my skin hydrated all day long. It has such a nice subtle and clean smell to it. Feels very nice on, not greasy at all. Does not cause me to break out either. Incredible product! 1 1\n","Love it 1 1\n","I love this so much. Feels perfect for my dry/sensitive skin. Closest formula I could find (the way it feels and moisturizes) to La Mer creme, except this has better ingredients in the sense that it contains no mineral oil. Much better ingredients. Love this, highly recommend and will continue to repurchase. 1 1\n","Moisturiser for face 1 3\n","This product is really really good, not too oily, leaves your skin soft and moisturized. This is the second time I buy it and there will be more. 1 1\n","Excellent moisturizer- lasting, blends with makeup, doesn’t clog pores. My go to every day moisturizer 1 1\n","Great moisturizer. I put this on at nighttime now that it’s the winter and it gives me just enough to keep my face fresh for the morning. Not too heavy or greasy all day. Great product. 1 1\n","Awesome face cream that really hydrates the skin. I put this on at night before sleeping and it keeps my face hydrated all day long. Great product, highly recommend if you have sensitive skin and problems with dry skin! 1 1\n","I love how hydrating this cream is yet not oily or sticky when you apply it on. It feels almost like velvet on my skin. The scent is absolutely amazing. 1 1\n","I bought this on a whim since I was looking for a new face cream which won’t break a bank. It is pretty amazing! 1 1\n","Not only does this Belif smell AMAZING, it's super refreshing as soon as I slather it on. One bottle has lasted me about 2 months using at least once a day (a little goes a long way) and I can definitely tell that my skin looks better - more youthful and hydrated. Definitely will reorder soon! 1 1\n","Love! I’m on my 2nd one already 1 1\n","Very hydrating. Will buy again & again 1 3\n","If you have dry skin then this cream will keep your skin moisturized for the whole day. I used IT Cosmetics Confidence Cream as a comparison and it did not do much to keep my skin longer than an hour, unlike Belif True Cream. I have pretty dry skin so this is great for me. It's a great brand and great product. 1 1\n","one word...AMAZING. I never in my life have found a better moisturizer for my dry skin especially in the winter months. Does not feel greasy and it smells amazing. I highly recommend this 1 1\n","This is by far my favorite face cream. I have dry skin and it leaves it dewey! 1 1\n","The only face cream that actually leaves my sensitive, almost 50 year old dry skin feeling moisturized all day. 1 1\n",":-?:*'*:?.-:?:-?* FABULOUS * -:?:- * HIGHLY RECOMMEND -:?:-?:*'*:?.-:?:- 1 1\n","Thick and smells great! 1 1\n","Lovely cream, soaks in well, makes my skin very soft when I use it overnight. 1 1\n","one of the best moisturizing creams i have ever tried! wife and I use it and it never feels greasy and locks in moisture. No irritation, no breakouts, it works for us! 1 1\n","Love it 1 1\n","Love this cream! Not greasy. 1 1\n","Good as always 1 1\n","My favourite! 1 3\n","Love the frangrance and feel on my skin. 1 1\n","Made my skin red and it tingled, which is really surprising as I am not normally sensitive.

I thought I was ordering the Aqua Bomb but I am in love with this one. Great moisturizer! 1 1\n","this is a white cream just like it's sol at sephora, etc. if you're looking for the blue cream, that is called the aqua bomb. this is the moisturizing bomb. SOOOO happy to have this! my favorite moisturizer. 1 1\n","Superlight, doesn't leave my face greasy BUT moisturized and easy to use. Smells fresh but not overpowering. 1 1\n","This is the cream for you! I? use it morning and night. It’s light, smells wonderful but most importantly, it works better than any moisturizer I’ve ever used! 1 1\n","Excellent moisturizer for dry skin or mature skin. 1 1\n","Incredible moisturizer. Great for dry - yet troubled skin 1 1\n","I’m a guy, who has problems with an oily forehead and dry nose area. This is a great product! Has made a huge difference with keeping my face hydrated on both areas 1 1\n","My skin is very sensitive to a lot of moisturizers. I can use this with no irritation and it moisturizes well. 1 1\n","Love the consistency of this product.

It is incredibly hydrating and has a light scent that isn't over powering. It is worth the price. It is heavierror than what I normally put on for day wear but they also have one that is lighter. 1 1\n","It's a perfect night cream for me! Hydrated and soft my skin! I would purchase it again once it finish. 1 1\n","Love ........ 1 1\n","Best moisturizer ever. 1 1\n","Not greasy but keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day. No overwhelming sweet smell. Yippee 1 0\n","great stuff for my dry skin and very fast delivery 1 1\n","This cream smells really good, and does a nice job of hydrating my skin. However, the issue is that it is pretty expensive for the amount of product you get. Plus this is not the kind of cream where a little goes a long way. It's a great product, but too expensive. 1 1\n","This product is great! A nice lightweight, yet effective moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling fresh. 1 1\n","I received mine just yesterday and the package was already opened. When I opened the amazon box it was rolling around in there, absolutely no seal on the product so I am hesitant to even try it... 0 0\n","Makes my eyes water all day - annoying and difficult to manage my day. Had to get rid of it. It has a long list of ingredients, have no idea what I'm allergic to, and I've never been allergic to anything... 0 0\n","I have bought this product before, multiple times and each time the product looks the same, a lighter blue and very thin consistency. When I put the product on, its weightless and never makes my face break out. However, the product I just received, was white in color, very thick and made my face break out! I honestly chalked it up to, the company possibly revamping the product and changing the consistency. So I decided to order it off the Belif website, when I received it, the product was the same as it always was. I even contacted the company to find out if anything changed and maybe I was getting an older product. I was told it was still the same. So..DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!! They are replacing the actual product with who knows what! I wouldn't trust anything you get from this place. 0 1\n","I first saw this on youtube, as someone I follow was giving a review on it. I get dry red patches on my face during certain times of the year. Things I tried just didn't work effectively enough. So after seeing the review I went to my sephoa to try it out, and get a sample to try for a couple days. Upon arriving home my mom said wow, it's barely red anymore looking in the mirror she was right! I was beyond amazed. It's really light, and gives a dewy look to your skin, which makes you look great too. It's a light sky blue color. I would definitely recommend trying this 1 1\n","I've been hearing a lot about Korean beauty products lately, so I thought I'd finally try one. I used Belif for the first time this evening, and I doubt that I will try it again. There were three problems: (1) it does not apply well. From my point of view, a good moisturizer should be very light, and the skin should absorb it rapidly. This product does not absorb well, it feels greasy, and my skin was sticky and irritated after application. I do have mature skin, but it is not sensitive or resistant to new products. (2) If you haven't seen a complete list of the ingredients, I suggest that you review them at the product's home site. I looked up most of the non-plant derived substances and found them all to be safe. However, I'm a little put off by a product that is for rubbing into your skin if it has more than 15-20 ingredients. This one has about 60. Most of them are plant-based (raspberry leaf extract, chickweed extract, alchemilla vulgaris leaf extract, willow bark extract, etc.) Many users see plant products and think they are getting something natural. Maybe, but a product that has so many chemicals on top of a lot of plant extracts may not be what's best for your skin. (3) I'm not that fond of the scent imparted by this product, either. I've seen reviews from other users who complained of an overpowering herbal-citrus scent. All in all, disappointing. I really wanted to like it, but there were too many obstacles. 0 0\n","This is an insane price for this! Go to Sephora or order it online from them! This stuff is amazing! Beyond my expectations! Worked the first time I used it and has long lasting results! I will never try anything else. This is what my face has needed forever! 1 1\n","I have fairly dry skin and tried this at the recommendation of somebody with similar skin. I use it for a day only as it's not quite enough for night during winter. Works well under make up and I'm very pleased. Only a little tiny bit goes a long way. Recommend it for those who have dry skin and for those that wear foundation and would like a seamless finish! 1 1\n","I am a faithful CeraVe user as recommended by a dermatologist - thought this was worth a try as I have dry patches that nothing seems to help. Hands down this is the most effective moisturizer I have come across. Noticed a difference within the first 24 hours and as mentioned in many reviews, the effects are long lasting. Been using about a week and although I cannot speak to wrinkle reduction, due to how supple and moisturized my facial skin is, the results seem to be a more youthful appearance. Love this stuff. Highly recommend it. 1 1\n","I'm not sure what's in this (I have very oily skin in case that made the difference), but I received a large sample from Sephora and this literally made my face sting! At first I thought maybe it was an adaptation issue so I tried it for a few days but it didn't go away. I did not get any moisturizing benefits and my face felt like it was stung for hours after I applied. 0 1\n","Excellent facial moisturizer. Non-greasy, leaves skin feeling very moist -especially around the eyes. 1 1\n","Amazing stuff. No oil or grease and it really keeps your face moisturized and hydrated all day. If the Aqua bomb is too light than definitely get this Moisturizing bomb. I tried their aqua bomb and it didn't moisturize me as well. This is both effective and light. 1 3\n","I really wanted to like it, but my skin broke out like crazy! Zits starting to form in the beard area. 0 0\n","Light but very hydrating, skin feels soft and smooth after!! 1 3\n","If I could give it more stars I would. I have never had a moisturizer do what this one does. I have this horrible dry skin all around my mouth and nose, and it feels so itchy and tight, I could never get enough of my previous moisturizer to make it go away. But I tried this after Sephora gave me a tiny sample and my life literally changed. Dry skin completely gone, and my makeup looks flawless now over this stuff. The most I've ever paid for moisturizer was probably just under $20 for Olay stuff, but Ive tried Aveeno and Neutrogena, etc. I will gladly pay $30 something for this because I know it works. A pinky nail size amount is all u really need ro get the job done. I even gave a few people at work a tiny sample because I want to share my secret. I should be a spokesperson for this! Oh, and it has this very very light lemony smell, but not over powering at all.Edit: It is now almost 8 months later, and it has lasted me this long. I'm buying another one today, even though the price went up almost $10. Oh well, it is definitely worth it. 1 1\n","Absolutely love this cream!!! I have aging, super-sensitive, super dry skin. And I hate too much scent in facial products. This has a very very slight scent which i find pleasing and my skin feels soft as silk the next morning, which I love! 1 1\n","I suffered so much trying to find the best product that can keep my face from drying and flaking. A little goes a long way but I do apply a little more on the areas I get the most dry skin. It stays all day long even after applying makeup. The price is worth it! I have tried many other products with higher prices and none have worked as good as this moisturizer so give it a chance you won't be disappointed. 1 1\n","Always in search for a great face lotion, and this product is fantastic. I wish it had sunscreen, but that's the ONLY downside. Best face cream I've ever owned, and it came as a sample product when I bought something from Sephora. I have dry skin and can't ever find something as moisturizing as this! 1 1\n","I live in the dry desert of AZ, so discovering this amazing face cream was WONDERFUL!! It feels incredible going on and makes my face so subtle and hydrated! I love its very light scent, and how a little goes a long way (I usually only use a fingertip’s worth). It makes all the past creams I’ve used seem watery and cheap by comparison! Been using this great moisturizer for a year now and won’t look back!!! 1 1\n","This moisturizer is weightless and absorbs quickly into the skin. I was skeptical that it would keep my skin hydrated, most moisturizers left me feeling dry after a few hours, but not with this product. It never feels tacky, but it leaves the skin wonderfully hydrated all day and night. It is easy to forget you have anything on your skin.I have sensitive and dry skin. I have a tendency to break out with other products, and my skin would often feel unhydrated even with the use of a thick and rich moisturizer.I love this product!!! I am obsessed and have at least one spare on hand at all times. 1 1\n","I liked this moisturizer. It was light and blended in very easily and really well. My face felt hydrated and I could tell a difference when I applied my makeup. I also liked that it was not oily and rinsed off with just water as it made me feel like it had simple ingredients without excessive oils. 1 1\n","Miracle cream. Received as a sample and I am on my second purchase. Amazing absorption and non-greasy feel. I have used Cerave for years at the recommendation of my dermatologist and have made a permanent switch. 1 1\n","This moisturizer is very light, however, it really helped my flaky, dry skin. I could even put it on my sensitive eye lids without a problem. I went to buy more today, however, found it is now $14 MORE than when I bought it 6 months ago. Quite the price increase!! I'll have to pass and find something else. 1 1\n","I have the driest skin and this Not only moisturizes my face and neck but it stays on on day and it’s not thick at all!!! If you have DRY SKIN you won’t go wrong with this! Also it does not break me out but my skin is Not that sensitive. It also give you a NICE sheen look!!!All day and it’s LIGHTWEIGHT!! Love this moisturizer!!! 1 1\n","This is the first product I have successfully used that does not worsen my rosacea and even improves it! Price is comparable with big box stores. 1 1\n","This has been my go to night moisturizer for a couple of years now, my skin tends to be dry in the winter and oily in the summer and this has been a fantastic balance for me. 1 1\n","I added this to my Roc treatment morning and night and it adds much needed moisturizer after I apply retinol. And just for a moisturizer alone, it’s fantastic too. If this is a knock off I can’t tell the difference between this and one I bought from sephora, so I am almost sure it’s not. 1 1\n","I have been using this cream now for more than three years. I have dry, sensitive skin, prone to congestion, and use a retinoid treatment. This is an incredible moisturizer for all year round. It is more moisturizing than the aqua bomb, it's gel equivalent, which might be what if you don't have drier skin. I love this product so much that I have bought it in bulk before--up to 10 jars at a time, which considering how much I love skincare and trying new things, means a lot. Definitely give it a try. 1 1\n","Definitely by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. It’s perfect a twice-daily use, doesn’t leave a residue (you know when you wash your face the next time and it feels slimy at first?) and is not offensive in smell. 1 1\n","My sister got me a sample of this, and just told me it was great. After a week of using it, my under eye dark circles went away! I used to live on my concealers for under eye, but now I barely have to use them since my skin tone has completely evened out! I give this to all my closest friends as a gift and they love it just as much. 1 1\n","Oh how I adore this stuff. Light to the touch, this is my new every day face cream. I don't go out in the sun too much during the day so I don't need to wear much sunscreen these days. I haven't noticed a huge change in the appearance of my skin, but I do like how this is a non-heavy product. 1 1\n","This is my second jar of this product. I have extremely dry skin and this product makes it baby smooth. It is very heavy, so I do not know how it would work with people who have oily skin. 1 3\n","I had insanely dry skin and couldn't find any moisturizer to help my dry skin, but this has made my skin soft again. I am very happy with this product. 1 1\n","I like it. Feels noce on mys skin. Smells nice. 1 1\n","amazing amazing amazing. I live in Las Vegas and it's very drying to skin here. This cream is lightweight but super moisturizing and I feel the texture of my skin getting softer. 1 1\n","I got a sample of this and fell in love. Now I order it here and my face is so soft. So refreshing once applied. I have sensitive skin and my skin does well with it. I've been using it for almost a year. 1 1\n","LOVE. Perfect amount of moisture if you have dry skin. Love this for after things like chemical peels. Super gentle. 1 1\n","this product is really great because it does not give any acne sensitive side effects. 1 1\n","One of the best moisturizers! Korean products are amazing 1 1\n","I first got a sample of this cream and had low expectations because my skin likes to break out when applying thick lotion (despite being dry). After just a night of use, I could tell a difference in my skin texture in the morning. Unlike so many lotions which seem to sit on your skin but never really quench it or penetrate beneath the surface, Belif really soaks in and gives you moisture that lasts. The skin on our faces renews itself about every two weeks. After two weeks of nightly use, my skin looked so much healthier. It had a natural glow that I'd never seen before. It even seems to smooth out fine lines due to the hydrating nature of the cream. The smell is very light and pleasant. It does seem pricy compared to drug store lotion but a little goes a long way because it is so emollient. I am very thankful I discovered this product! 1 1\n","Love this face lotion and it smells amazing 1 1\n","Love this moisturizer. I use it every day after I shower and it's super hydrating on the skin. A little goes a long way! 1 1\n","This is the best face cream/gel I've ever used. 1 1\n","Lightweight yet moisturizing, and does not feel greasy. Love this cream for day or night! 1 0\n","Love it! It's so moisturizing and doesn't irritate. 1 1\n","Great moisturizer for super dry skin! 1 1\n","Great product. More long-lasting effect from this product than any other.......... 1 1\n","One of the best products that I have ever purchased! Love it, great seller. Fast shipping 1 1\n","Amazing value and amazing product. SO moisturizing!!! 1 1\n","Great moisturizer. Would highly recommend 1 1\n","Great product 1 1\n","I resived the cream in another color 1 3\n","nice cream 1 1\n","the best moisturizer ever for normal to dry skin- moisturizing but not too oily 1 1\n","I received this in an Ipsy bag loved it so much I bought the full size. This is the only moisturizer that hydrate skins for up to 26 hours, leaves skin supple, soft and smooth. Makeup applies easily after application. Even in the cold winter my skin looks great no dry spots. It's the perfect moisturizer kind of expensive but the Korean people are skin experts so worth it. I'm telling everyone about this marvelous product. I'm 58 and have dry skin with light wrinkles it makes me look much younger. That's a plus for sure. I also have sensitive skin and no irritation noted just soft and supple you'll love it. 1 1\n","I bought this product twice after being recommended in store at Sephora for the winter months in the Northeast USA. I have dry/combination skin and this product is light and applies easily, but does not leave a greasy shine throughout the day. I highly recommend, my face has not broken out from using this product and the combination and dry areas of my face are all even in complexion and hydration. 1 1\n","Love this!!! 1 1\n","It was okay, I don't think it's the real product. Doesn't smell like it and the consistency is not the same if you by it from a Sephora or department store. Don't risk it, just go in store! 0 1\n","very good 1 1\n","I am a skincare and makeup junkie. This has to be BY FAR the best moisturizer that I have ever had the pleasure of putting on my skin. Just make sure that you purchase it from a retailer that is in the US, because I didn't and had to wait a month for it to be delivered. 1 1\n","I have spent so much money on moisturizers. I've tried drugstore brands and very expensive brands. They were all just so-so. Not this cream. It takes a small amount and absorbs quickly. You skin feels hydrated, not just soft on the top layer. It's hard to explain how good your skin feels. It feels like the moisture is deep, not superficial. I can't explain it any better. Just get it. You will love it. Two days after I bought my first jar, I ordered a second jar so I would never run out. The best I have ever used. 1 1\n","I'll start by saying, I ONLY gave this moisturizer a 4 out of 5 because I wish it was in a squeezie tube or a container with a pump, as opposed to being in a jar. That being said, this is my go-to moisturizer, for day and night. I love it. Not super greasy or heavy, but very moisturizing. Smells great- a light lemony herbal scent. To help it spread over my skin smoother, and to add a little something extra, I do add 2-3 drops of an affordable jojoba oil. Makes this even better. I have sensitive, combo oily skin that is acne prone. This doesn't break me out or cause any irritation. Love this stuff. Obviously it's going to cost you a pretty penny compared to a lot of cheap drugstore lotions and creams... but it's worth it if you ask me! I've gone through 4 sample sizes (which are very generous samples), almost done with my first full size jar. My backup jar is on the way!! 1 1\n","Great face lotion. Very hydrating without being greasy! 1 1\n","I like it but I am not sure it is worth the wait 1 1\n","I used to have really dry(splitting) skin on my face and terrible cystic acne. After several cycles of bactim, TCA, and salicylic acid peels my skin became SUPER oily. So why did I get this? I found the less supplemental moisturizer I used the oiler my skin got.So I got this for night time to help boost moisture in my skin to prevent excess oil production. It's super moisturizing without being greasy. Although it is thick, it blends into skin well and doesn't feel mask like. I found that I could actually wear it under my makeup without problems too. So I now use it morning and night time. It make my skin feel super smooth & soft. It is also non irritating. If I accidently get it around my eye area it doesn't burn (most face moisturizers burn my eye lids/under eyes). It has helped calm oil production quite a bit. I will definitely repurchase this. I highly suggest belifs moisturizing & firming eye cream as well 1 1\n","This moisturizer is the absolute best, and I’ve tried everything from super high end to drug store. My skin is always dry, and winter makes it worse. This sinks deeps in the skin and plumps it up and keeps it soft and moisturized all day. If you end up with a greasy film you’ve probably used too much. You only need a pinky nail sized amount. The jar will last forever. I use the Aqua bomb( the blue) in the summer for a little less moisture and the Moisture bomb (the white) in the winter for extra moisture. I can get a whole year out of two jars. This is worth every penny, and more. 1 1\n","(Moreso 3.5 stars) I have to say, even though I will probably not rebuy (just is not my favorite type of cream-gel), I wholeheartedly suggest this for people with normal to oil skin! I got a good amount of plumping, moisture, and priming for my makeup, but it does not stand out to me that much, over other options. For a much lower price, I suggest Hada Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel-Cream at Walgreens for $15-25, as it is less than half the price, you get the same amount, less silicones, better ingredients overall, and it is more accessible on the whim. 1 1\n","I use this cream as the final step in my skincare routine at night. I originally bought this cream to use as an overall cream for both morning and night but found it a little too heavy to use in the morning under makeup. Here's my experience with it after using it for approximately 2-3 months: + moisturizes very well + a tiny bit goes a long way + has a pleasant scent (I swear it smells a little like ginger??) + slightly tacky and greasy when applied, better as a night cream in my opinion + prevents dry, flaky skin I will probably repurchase this, but may try the aqua bomb version after this one just to see how it feels. This is a great product for people with super dry skin. 1 1\n","This stuff is the BOMB!! My skin is super sensitive and can be very oily.. this moisturizer is perfect. I’m looking to use their other products! 1 1\n","I really like this. It moisturizes and sinks in quickly, light gel. I'm getting older so I may need something a little heavier, but overall this is a nice clean feeling moisturizer and I like it. 1 1\n","I love this stuff but it is way cheaper at Sephora- $38.00 for 1.68 oz and $22.00 for 0.84 oz 1 1\n","I have the entire kit. So far, its okay. I do like that the moisturizer is light with out a heavy smell. I noticed a difference after a few days of doing the new products. I want to see the difference after a few weeks of using all the products together. 1 1\n","No fuss, no strong perfume smell, excellent product. My face loves it! 1 1\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9bdwoGfg8r7-","outputId":"20b27838-9c11-46dc-a086-0006e40bfcda","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1664858202998,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"정연수","userId":"02873126808620457795"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"source":["for i in range(df.id.count()):\n","    if vaderresult[i]==df.reviewrating[i]:\n","        truecount=truecount+1\n","# 정확도\n","print(\"정확도 : \", truecount/(df.id.count()))\n","print(\"정확도 : \", format(truecount/(df.id.count()), \".3f\"))\n","#print(\"정확도 : \", round(truecount/(df.id.count()), 3))\n"],"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["정확도 :  0.8857142857142857\n","정확도 :  0.886\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"35YnA52S8wfO"},"source":[],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
